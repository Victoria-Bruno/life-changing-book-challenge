            <h3>Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men</h3>
            <p>
              Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by
              men, <b>we are systematically ignoring half the population</b>. It
              exposes the gender data gap -
              <b
                >a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual,
                systemic discrimination against women</b
              >, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a
              profound effect on women&apos; lives. From government policy and
              medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and
              the media,
              <b>Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women</b
              >. Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez
              brings together for the first time an impressive range of
              <b
                >case studies, stories and new research from across the world</b
              >
              that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and
              the impact this has on their health and well-being. In making the
              case for change, this powerful and provocative book will make you
              see the world anew.

            <h2>Author</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Caroline Emma Criado Perez</b> (born 1984) is a British
              feminist author, journalist and activist. Her first national
              campaign, the Women's Room project, aimed to increase the presence
              of female experts in the media. She opposed the removal of the
              only woman from British banknotes (other than The Queen), leading
              to the Bank of England's swift announcement that the image of Jane
              Austen would appear on the £10 note by 2017. That campaign led to
              sustained harassment on the social networking website Twitter of
              Criado Perez and other women; as a result, Twitter announced plans
              to improve its complaint procedures. Her most recent campaign was
              for a sculpture of a woman in Parliament Square; the statue of
              Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in April 2018, as part of the
              centenary celebrations of the winning of women's suffrage in the
              United Kingdom. Her 2019 book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias
              in a World Designed for Men was a Sunday Times bestseller.

          <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This book is a must read for ANY HUMAN. Don’t let the title fool
            you, it is not a book that concerns only women. It literally
            revolutionised my view of the world. <br /><br />
            Do you drive a car? Do you use public transportation? Do you run
            errands through the city? Do you use public toilets? Then the book
            is for you. Whether you work in academia, healthcare, business,
            politics… it covers it all. <br /><br />
            As a woman in tech I get bombarded by campaigns about women in
            leadership, mentorship programs for young girls in STEM, or women
            networks. I never really got the point of them as much as after
            reading the entire book. All humans should take the mission of
            addressing and acting on data bias at heart, either by taking
            initiative or actively listening and supporting, because it really
            does concerns us all. And personally I understand more the
            importance of representation. <br /><br />

            Big thanks to the author Caroline for her terrific work to unveil
            and collect all this information, investigating such diverse sectors
            and domains. She’s a true inspiration for me, and I hope to
            contribute to her work by exposing and acting on data bias in my
            field.

              “Perhaps most galling from a gender-data-gap perspective was the
              finding that females aren&apos;t even included in animal studies
              on female-prevalent diseases. Women are 70% more likely to suffer
              depression than men, for instance, but animal studies on brain
              disorders are five times as likely to be done on male animals.” ―

              “So with that substantial sex difference in mind: how many drugs
              that would work for women are we ruling out at phase one trials
              just because they don’t work in men?”

              “since the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, workplace
              fatalities in the UK have dropped by 85%. But there is a caveat to
              this good news story. While serious injuries at work have been
              decreasing for men, there is evidence that they have been
              increasing among women.7 The rise in serious injuries among female
              workers is linked to the gender data gap: with occupational
              research traditionally having been focused on male-dominated
              industries, our knowledge of how to prevent injuries in women is
              patchy to say the least.”

              “The formula to determine standard office temperature was
              developed in the 1960s around the metabolic resting rate of the
              average forty-year-old, 70 kg man.1 But a recent study found that
              ‘the metabolic rate of young adult females performing light office
              work is significantly lower’ than the standard values for men
              doing the same type of activity. In fact, the formula may
              overestimate female metabolic rate by as much as 35%, meaning that
              current offices are on average five degrees too cold for women.
              Which leads to the odd sight of female office workers wrapped up
              in blankets in the New York summer while their male colleagues
              wander around in summer clothes.”

              “Employment procedures that are unwittingly biased towards men are
              an issue in promotion as well as hiring. A classic example comes
              from Google, where women weren’t nominating themselves for
              promotion at the same rate as men. This is unsurprising: women are
              conditioned to be modest, and are penalised when they step outside
              of this prescribed gender norm.”

              “But male universality is also a cause of the gender data gap:
              because women aren't seen and aren't remembered, because male data
              makes up the majority of what we know, what is male comes to be
              seen as universal. It leads to the positioning of women, half of
              the global population, as a minority. With a niche identity and a
              subjective point of view. In such a framing, women are set up to
              be forgettable Ignorable. Dispensable - from culture, from
              history, from data. And so, women become invisible.”

              the same time somehow not seeing any of this discrimination. Or
              really, we don’t see it because we naturalise it – it is too
              obvious, too commonplace, too much just the way things are to
              bother commenting on.”
